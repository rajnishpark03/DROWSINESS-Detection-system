Drowsiness Detection System
Overview

This repository contains a drowsiness detection system implemented using the YOLO algorithm and cascading object detection. The system aims to accurately detect if a person is drowsy or awake based on their facial expressions.

Key Features

YOLO Algorithm: Utilizes the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm for real-time object detection, specifically targeting faces in images or video streams.
Cascading Object Detection: Employs a cascading classifier to refine face detection and improve accuracy.
Drowsiness Detection: Leverages machine learning models (e.g., convolutional neural networks) to analyze facial features and determine drowsiness levels.
Real-time Processing: Designed for efficient processing, enabling real-time drowsiness detection in video streams.
